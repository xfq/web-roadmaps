      <h1>Payment and Services</h1>
      <p>Native mobile application stores have made it much easier for developers to monetize some of their applications, either by selling the application itself to users, or by providing in-app purchases.</p>

      <p>While Web applications can use well-known on-line payment solutions, these solutions have so far proved much harder to use on mobile devices.</p>

        <p data-feature="Autocomplete">HTML provides specific help for <a data-featureid="autocomplete">autocomplete of credit card details</a> (through the <code>cc-<em>xxx</em></code> autocomplete tokens), making it easier to pay via credit cards once these details have been entered once.</p>

        <p>Following a successful <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/">workshop on Web payments</a> in 2014 and discussions on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">use cases and priorities for Web payments</a> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payment Interest Group</a>, W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/charter-201510.html">chartered a Web Payments Working Group</a> to develop browser APIs to facilitate payment operations in Web applications:</p>

        <ul data-feature="Web Payment">
          <li>The <a data-featureid="payment-request">Payment Request API</a> defines an API to allow merchants (i.e. web sites selling physical or digital goods) to utilize one or more payment methods with minimal integration. In this model, browsers facilitate the payment flow between merchant and user.</li>
          <li>The <a data-featureid="payment-method-basic-card">Basic Card Payment</a> specification describes data structures that enable the use of debit and credit cards in the Payment Request API.</li>
          <li>The <a data-featureid="payment-handler">Payment Handler API</a> defines a standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and applications.</li>
        </ul>
