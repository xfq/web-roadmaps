      <h1>Application Lifecycle</h1>

      <p>An important aspect of the user experience of applications is linked to how the application integrates with the rest of the system to provide a native-like experience that features a responsive user interface that is permanently available, even when offline, which is particularly important on mobile devices, installable on the user's home screen, and re-engageable (meaning that it is easy to push notifications to the user to re-engage her into the application).</p>

      <p>These notions are part of the overall <strong>application lifecycle</strong>: how applications get installed, shown to the user in applications list, started, stopped, woken up from remote notifications, synced up when the device goes on-line. They form the backbone of <strong>Progressive Web Applications</strong> (PWA).</p>

        <div data-feature="Offline Web Apps">
          <p>HTML5â€™s <code><a data-featureid="appcache">ApplicationCache</a></code> enables access to Web applications offline through the definition of a manifest of files that the browser is expected to keep in its cache. The feature is well deployed but this approach is extremely limited in terms of how much developers can control what gets cached when. The feature has been obsoleted in HTML 5.1, in favor of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers-1/">Service Workers</a> specification, which defines a much more powerful approach.</p>
        </div>

        <div data-feature="Foreground Detection">
          <p>The <strong><a data-featureid="page-visibility">Page Visibility</a></strong> specification lets developers detect when their application is in the foreground, and thus adapt their operations and resource consumption accordingly.</p>
        </div>

      <section class="featureset in-progress">
        <h2>Technologies in progress</h2>
        <div data-feature="Packing">
          <p>Whether packaged or not, users rely on a variety of metadata (name, icons) to identify the apps they want to use among their list of regularly used applications. The <a data-featureid="appmanifest">Web App Manifest</a> specification lets developers group all these metadata into a single JSON file.</p>
        </div>

        <div data-feature="Offline Web Apps">
          <p>The <a data-featureid="serviceworkers">Service Workers</a> specification describes a method that enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing, opening the door to running applications offline.</p>
          <p>Not only does Service Worker enables Web applications to work seamlessly offline or in poor network conditions, it also creates a model for Web applications to operate when they have not been opened in a browser window, or even if the browser itself is not running. That ability opens the door for Web applications that run in the background and can react to remotely triggered events.</p>
        </div>

        <div data-feature="Remote Notifications">
          <p>The <a data-featureid="push">Push API</a> enables Web applications to subscribe to remote notifications that, upon reception, wake them up. Native applications have long enjoyed the benefits of greater user engagement that these notifications bring.</p>
        </div>

        <div data-feature="Background Sync">
          <p>The <a data-featureid="background-sync">Web Background Synchronization</a> specification builds on top of Service Workers to enable Web applications to keep their user data up to date seamlessly, by running network operations in the background, adjusting to possibly unreliable connections that users often experience on mobile devices.</p>

        <h2>Exploratory work</h2>

        <div data-feature="Packing">
          <p>The <a data-featureid="packaging">Web Packaging</a> document describes use cases for a new package format for web sites and applications and outlines such a format.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Web Lifecycle</dt>
          <dd>Applications running on mobile devices can go through different application states, from running to being idle, paused, stopped, discarded, or terminated. Transitions between these states are triggered by the underlying operating system, and hidden from web applications. The recent <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/92">Web Lifecycle</a> proposal discusses the possiblity to expose application state transitions to applications so that these applications can persist/restore state, enable/disable use of network, etc.</dd>

        <h2>Discontinued features</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt>Task Scheduling</dt>
          <dd>The <a data-featureid="task-scheduler">Task Scheduler API</a> makes it possible to trigger a task at a specified time via the service worker associated with a Web app. This specification was in scope of the now-closed System Applications Working Group and was shelved as a result.</dd>

          <dt>Geofencing API</dt>
          <dd>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/geofencing-api/" data-featureid="geofencing">geofencing API</a> made it possible to wake up a Web app when a device enters a specified geographical area. This work has been discontinued, partly out of struggles to find a good approach to permission needs that such an API triggers to protect users against privacy issues. Work on this specification could resume in the future depending on interest from would-be implementers.</dd>
